#### how much time did i spend?
around 4 hours building and maybe 60/30 minutes researching and testing.

#### Looking back
i never created a gallery before. so this was a fun challenge for me. I was not sure if i want to use a Json file or a forEach for the images. But with the json file is a lot easier with adding text or add more images. Plus it was easier to add a limiter. I hope you will like the result!!!
